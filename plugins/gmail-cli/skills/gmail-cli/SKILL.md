# Gmail (CLI)

Use this plugin when Gmail access needs the raw Google Workspace CLI path, especially for binary attachments, unsupported MIME types, raw message payloads, label IDs, original MIME source, or exact API metadata that the curated Gmail connector cannot return.

This is a product plugin backed by the installed `gws` CLI. Keep `gmail@openai-curated` available for normal mailbox search, thread summaries, drafts, sends, archive/delete actions, and user-friendly inbox triage. Use this CLI plugin as the precise fallback.

## Start

```bash
command -v gws
gws auth status
gws gmail users getProfile --params '{"userId":"me"}'
```

If Gmail commands fail with `API not enabled`, the OAuth account can be valid while the Google Cloud project still lacks `gmail.googleapis.com`. Enable Gmail API for the project shown by `gws auth status`, wait briefly, then retry.

## Search And Inspect

Prefer Gmail search syntax for message discovery:

```bash
gws gmail users messages list --params '{"userId":"me","q":"from:bbva has:attachment newer_than:1y","maxResults":10}'
gws gmail users messages get --params '{"userId":"me","id":"MESSAGE_ID","format":"metadata","metadataHeaders":["From","To","Subject","Date"]}'
gws gmail users messages get --params '{"userId":"me","id":"MESSAGE_ID","format":"full"}'
```

Use `format=metadata` for first-pass reads and `format=full` only for shortlisted messages where payload parts, attachment IDs, or headers matter.

Use bounded pagination when needed:

```bash
gws gmail users messages list --params '{"userId":"me","q":"has:attachment filename:pdf newer_than:2y","maxResults":100}' --page-all --page-limit 3
```

## Attachments

List attachments in a shortlisted message:

```bash
python3 scripts/gmail_cli.py attachments --message-id MESSAGE_ID
```

Download by filename:

```bash
python3 scripts/gmail_cli.py download-attachment \
  --message-id MESSAGE_ID \
  --filename "Contrato Digital.zip" \
  --output ./Contrato-Digital.zip
```

Download by Gmail attachment ID:

```bash
python3 scripts/gmail_cli.py download-attachment \
  --message-id MESSAGE_ID \
  --attachment-id ATTACHMENT_ID \
  --output ./attachment.bin
```

Resolve `scripts/gmail_cli.py` relative to the Gmail plugin root. If you are reading this skill from a plugin cache path, the helper is two directories above this skill file at `../../scripts/gmail_cli.py`.

The helper decodes Gmail's base64url `data` field and writes the binary bytes. Verify the downloaded artifact before relying on it:

```bash
ls -lh ./Contrato-Digital.zip
file ./Contrato-Digital.zip
unzip -l ./Contrato-Digital.zip
```

For password-protected ZIPs or PDFs, use the password instructions from the email body. Do not guess or expose sensitive identifiers in public docs.

## Raw MIME

Use raw format when exact original MIME content matters:

```bash
gws gmail users messages get --params '{"userId":"me","id":"MESSAGE_ID","format":"raw"}'
```

Decode the returned `raw` field as base64url if you need to inspect the original `.eml` locally.

## Labels And Mutations

Prefer the curated Gmail connector for user-facing archive/delete/label/draft/send actions. If a raw CLI mutation is necessary, read the target message first and use a dry-run-style preview in your explanation before applying changes.

Common read commands:

```bash
gws gmail users labels list --params '{"userId":"me"}'
gws gmail users messages get --params '{"userId":"me","id":"MESSAGE_ID","format":"metadata"}'
```

## Raw API Help

Use schema discovery before unfamiliar fields or methods:

```bash
gws schema gmail.users.messages.list --resolve-refs
gws schema gmail.users.messages.get --resolve-refs
gws schema gmail.users.messages.attachments.get --resolve-refs
gws schema gmail.users.labels.list --resolve-refs
```

## Rules

- Prefer message IDs over subjects; subjects and sender names are not unique.
- Prefer metadata-only discovery before reading bodies or full payloads.
- Use `gmail@openai-curated` first for normal search/read/thread/draft workflows; use this plugin when raw payload or binary attachment handling matters.
- Read before archive, delete, label, send, or draft mutations. Ask before destructive mailbox changes unless the user already explicitly approved the exact action.
- Keep downloaded email artifacts in the current workspace or a clearly named temporary folder, and verify file type/size after download.
- Treat raw attachments, contracts, bank docs, IDs, and policy documents as private. Do not paste sensitive numbers into generated public docs or messages unless the user explicitly asks.
