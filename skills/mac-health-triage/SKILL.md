description: Diagnose macOS CPU heat, fan spin, memory pressure, swap, OOM risk, and stale agent/helper processes. Use when the user asks why their Mac is hot/slow, wants CPU/RAM/swap checked, mentions fan noise, memory leaks, OOM, Codex/Claude/Atlas heat, Chronicle, Computer Use, or wants a safe cleanup plan.

# Mac Health Triage

Use this skill to answer: "What is making my Mac hot?", "Am I close to OOM?", and "Are Codex/Claude/Atlas/Computer Use leaking or accumulating helpers?"

## Rules

- Start read-only. Do not kill processes, edit config, disable Chronicle, or quit apps unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not use AppleScript, Accessibility, Computer Use, or app-window control by default. Those can trigger macOS Automation prompts. Use process snapshots first.
- Separate CPU heat from memory/OOM risk. A machine can be hot with acceptable RAM, or memory-pressured with low CPU.
- Report current facts first, then interpretation, then a cleanup plan.
- Treat a single hot sample as a spike until confirmed with a second sample. Use a short two-sample `top` check when a process looks surprising.
- Prefer app-family totals over isolated Electron renderer names. Renderer PIDs are useful, but the user wants the practical app/process family.
- Never call something a classic memory leak unless one PID grows over time. Many small stale helpers are a process-lifecycle leak or process accumulation, not necessarily a heap leak.
- For exact current status, always take a fresh snapshot. Old memory of previous culprit processes is only a pattern to compare against.

## Snapshot Command

Run the bundled script first:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/mac-health-triage/scripts/mac_health_snapshot.sh
```

If the script is unavailable, use this read-only bundle:

```bash
top -l 2 -s 2 -n 25 -o cpu -stats pid,ppid,command,cpu,mem,rsize,threads,state,time
memory_pressure
sysctl vm.swapusage
vm_stat
ps -axo pid=,ppid=,etime=,stat=,pcpu=,pmem=,rss=,comm=,args= | rg -i 'Codex|codex|SkyComputerUseClient|Computer Use|codex_chronicle|Claude|ChatGPT Atlas|WindowServer|replayd|superwhisper'
```

## Interpret CPU Heat

Rank by sustained CPU, not one spike.

Watch these app families:

- `Codex+ComputerUse`: `Codex.app`, `codex app-server`, `Codex Helper (Renderer)`, `codex_chronicle`, `SkyComputerUseClient`.
- `Claude`: `Claude.app`, `Claude Helper`, Claude Code child process.
- `ChatGPT Atlas`: main app, renderers, GPU/service helpers.
- Screen/capture stack: `WindowServer`, `replayd`, `coreaudiod`, `VTDecoderXPCService`, camera/video services.
- Other recurring local apps: `superwhisper`.

Practical CPU signals:

- Any app family above `100%` CPU while idle is suspicious.
- A single renderer above `100%` CPU can heat the machine even if memory is fine.
- `WindowServer` above `30-40%` while idle points to display/compositing/screen-capture pressure.
- `replayd` high alongside Codex Chronicle or Computer Use points to screen-recording/capture overhead.
- `kernel_task` high can be thermal throttling rather than the original culprit.

## Interpret Memory And OOM Risk

Use `memory_pressure`, `sysctl vm.swapusage`, and app-family RSS.

Practical risk bands for this user's 8 GB Mac:

- Swap `0-2 GB`: acceptable.
- Swap `2-4 GB`: pressured; watch it.
- Swap `4-6 GB`: heavy pressure; restart heavy apps soon.
- Swap `6 GB+`: restart/quit heavy apps or reboot.
- Compressed memory above about `1.5-2 GB` means macOS is working hard to avoid swapping more.
- A 40-day-plus uptime with swap pressure is a strong reboot candidate, even if no single app is obviously broken.

When RAM looks bad, list the largest RSS app families and large sleeping processes. On this machine, Electron/browser apps add up quickly: Codex, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT Atlas, and browser/video tabs.

## Agent-Specific Leak And Accumulation Signals

### Computer Use

`SkyComputerUseClient` belongs to Codex Computer Use.

Observed local pattern:

- Before Codex restart, `SkyComputerUseClient` reached about `55` processes, using roughly `321 MB` RSS and `12.5%` CPU, with many processes alive for hours.
- Restarting Codex dropped the count to about `3`, reduced swap from about `5 GB` to about `2.3 GB`, and lowered load average.

Interpretation:

- This looked like process accumulation or a process-lifecycle leak.
- It did not look like a classic heap memory leak because each helper was small.
- If the count climbs from `0-3` to dozens after Computer Use or background Codex activity, flag it.

Practical thresholds:

- `0-3`: normal after fresh restart.
- `10+`: suspicious.
- `30+`: likely buildup.
- `50+`: actionable; recommend restarting Codex.

### Chronicle

`codex_chronicle` is Codex's screen-context/memory background feature.

Watch for:

- `codex_chronicle` above `10-20%` CPU for several minutes.
- Repeated `codex_chronicle --capture-screenshot-child`.
- Background `codex exec` memory-writer processes stacking up.
- High `WindowServer` or `replayd` at the same time.

Do not blame Chronicle automatically. In the local evidence, Chronicle was plausibly adjacent, but the visible process accumulation was `SkyComputerUseClient`.

Also check `~/.codex/config.toml` for:

```toml
notify = [".../SkyComputerUseClient", "turn-ended"]
[features]
chronicle = true
```

If both are present, Chronicle/background turns plus a `turn-ended` notify hook may plausibly amplify Computer Use helper spawning. This is a hypothesis, not proof.

### Codex

Flag Codex if:

- `Codex Helper (Renderer)` stays hot while idle.
- `codex app-server` stays hot while idle.
- `SkyComputerUseClient` count grows over time.
- Restarting Codex clears helpers and reduces swap/load.

Cleanest first action is usually quitting and reopening Codex, not killing individual child processes.

### ChatGPT Atlas

Atlas/Chromium can spike during video, page load, or GPU activity. Confirm with a second sample.

For YouTube/video:

- A brief renderer spike above `100%` can happen.
- Steady low single-digit CPU after a second sample is normal.
- Around `700 MB-1.3 GB` RSS for a Chromium browser with video/tabs is not shocking on this machine, but it contributes to swap pressure.

Avoid AppleScript tab/window title checks unless the user approves macOS Automation prompts.

### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop renderers can use hundreds of MB. Flag only if CPU is sustained high, RSS grows over time, or Claude Code child processes remain active unexpectedly.

## Cleanup Recommendations

Use the least destructive action that matches the evidence:

1. Hot browser renderer only: pause/close/refresh the tab or quit Atlas.
2. Hot Codex renderer or many `SkyComputerUseClient`: quit and reopen Codex.
3. Chronicle/capture stack hot: pause Chronicle temporarily, then re-check.
4. `superwhisper` hot and unused: quit it.
5. Swap above `4-6 GB`: close heavy Electron/browser apps.
6. Long uptime plus swap remains high after app restarts: reboot.

Only suggest commands like `pkill -f SkyComputerUseClient` as a second-best surgical cleanup when normal Codex quit does not work.

## Answer Shape

Use this format:

```text
Verdict:
- CPU heat: hot / okay / cooling
- OOM risk: low / medium / high
- Main culprit: app family and process

Evidence:
- Top sustained CPU processes
- Memory/swap/compression
- Agent helper counts

What I would do:
- 1-3 concrete actions, least destructive first
```

Mention uncertainty explicitly:

- "confirmed" for current process counts and memory.
- "plausible" for Chronicle/notify/Computer Use causality.
- "not proven" for internal product bugs or classic memory leaks.
